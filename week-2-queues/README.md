# Programming Assignment 2: Randomized Queues and Deques

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary
data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

## Dequeue
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced "deck") is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports inserting
and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

## Randomized Queue
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from
items in the data structure.

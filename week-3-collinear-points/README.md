# Programming Assignment 3: Pattern Recognition

Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real-world objects that produced
them. The process in often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition. Feature detection
involves selecting important features of the image; pattern recognition involves discovering patterns in the features.
We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments. This kind of
pattern recognition arises in many other applications such as statistical data analysis.
